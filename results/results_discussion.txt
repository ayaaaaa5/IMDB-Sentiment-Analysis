Results Discussion
==========================================================================================

The custom Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) achieved approximately 75% test accuracy using
sentence-level polarity features extracted from VADER and TextBlob.

The confusion matrix indicates balanced behavior between positive and negative
classes.

The training and validation loss curves decrease smoothly and remain close to
each other across epochs. 
-->This indicates stable convergence and no significant
overfitting.

Although the model does not achieve very high accuracy, this performance is
reasonable given that only six sentence-level polarity features were used.

Overall, the model demonstrates correct implementation of forward propagation,
binary cross-entropy loss, backpropagation, and gradient descent.
